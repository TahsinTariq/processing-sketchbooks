# Processing Sketchbooks

_collections of short programs (sketches) written in Processing_

This repository hosts for original work, teaching examples, and forum demo code, primarily written during 2016 in Processing 3. It may eventually hold older sketchbooks from Processing 1, 2, and 3, roughly 2004-present.
